# ES6/ES2015
* This set of notes is a summary of the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) course [Getting Started with ES2015](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-started-with-es2015-2).

## Variables in ES6

* `var` can create unexpected and problematic behaviours
* `const` and `let` replace the `var` keyword in ES6

### The `const` keyword

* `const` keyword defines a constant variable
* Use constants for data that should never change
* This often the best default choice when defining variables
* Prevents your variable from being overwritten by any stray assignments in your code
* Variables defined with `const` cannot be reassigned (though they can be altered, for e.g adding a value to an array defined as a constant)
* If you try to overwrite a constant, you will get the message `Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`
* A common problem is that variables defined within the scope of functions may inadvertently overwrite a global variable
* E.g

```js
var name = "Michael";

function createFullName(fName, lName) {
    name = fName + " " + lName;
    console.log(name);
}

console.log(name)
createFullName("John", "Doe");
```

* In the above code, the `name` variable inside the `createFullName` function will overwrite the global `name` variable
* Using `const` will prevent this kind of reassignment

#### Using `const` with Arrays and Objects

* Though constants cannot be reassigned, objects and arrays defined as constants can still be modified without any `TypeError`

### The `let` keyword

* Used for variables that will change
* Works similarly to `var` keyword
* Unlike `var`, `let` has block-level scoping, meaning that a variable defined with `let` is only assessible within the block in which it is defined and any sub-blocks, but it is not globally accessible or accessible anywhere within a function
* E.g:

```js
function example(foo) {
    if (foo) {
        let bar = foo;
    }
    console.log(bar);
}
```

* If `example` is called it will produce the error `Uncaught ReferenceError: bar is not defined` because the `bar` variable is only available inside the conditional block in which it was defined

### Using `let` in `for` loops

* When using a `for` loop with an index `i`, in many cases each iteration of the loop will require `i` in the local scope otherwise strange behaviours can result
* Using the `var` keyword to define the index creates an index with global scope
* Using `let` creates an index with block-level scope, making the index distinct at each iteration


## Template Literals

* Template literals create strings in JavaScript but with some added conveniences
* Template literals use backticks `` ` `` instead of single or double quotes
* Template literals allow strings to be much cleaner and easier to write by taking away the need to concatenate many strings together
* E.g:

```js
const fruits = "<ul>" +
"<li>Kiwi</li>" +
"<li>Lime</li>" +
"<li>Pineapple</li>";

```
vs
```js
const vegetables =
    `<ul>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
    </ul>`
```
* The second example is obviously easier to read and write

### String interpolation

* When writing a dynamic site or application you often need to show a value that does not yet exist
* This is often done with string concatenation
* But with template literals, you can use interpolation to add placeholders that will be evaluated later
* String interpolation allows for easy injection of dynamic data into strings
* E.g:

```js
const greeting = "Hello, " + name + ", nice to see you.";
```
vs
```js
const greeting = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you.`;
```

* Obviously the second example is easier to read and write, and allows for you to inject dynamic content into a string without concatenation using the `${varName}` syntax
* The dynamic content is added, or **interpolated** into the string at runtime
* The content inside the braces can be any legal JavaScript expression, including function calls


## Arrow Functions

* ES2015 introduces a simplified function syntax
* Arrow functions use the `=>` "fat arrow" operator
* Arrow functions omit the `function` keyword and add the fat arrow operator
* E.g:

```js
var helloWorld = function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

becomes

```js
const hellowWorld = () => {
    console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

* Arrow functions that accept arguments have the same syntax as arrow functions that accept no arguments
* However, arrow functions that accept only a single argument do not need parentheses
* E.g

```js
const square = x => {
    return x * x;
}
```

* If the arrow function body contains only a single line of code returning a value, then the `return` keyword can be omitted:

```js
const cube = x => { square(x) * x; }
```

* This syntax will return the value of the JavaScript statement contained in the braces without the `return` keyword
* Furthermore, if you only have a single line of code in an arrow function, the braces can be dropped completely:

```js
const cube = x => square(x) * x;
```

* The same function in four different syntaxes:

```js
//Function Declaration

function divide1(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

//Function Expression

const divide2 = function(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression

const divide3 = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression - concise

const divide4 = (a, b) => a / b;
```
