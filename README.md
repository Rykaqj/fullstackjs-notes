# Full-stack JavaScript Notes
This is a collection of notes on courses from the Full-stack JavaScript and React.js tracks at [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com/), as well as other courses on other platforms I have taken or things I think are good to know for a JavaScript developer. The collection is not complete, as there are a number of basic courses that I have taken but not made notes on. The set of notes is a work in progress and will be updated regularly to reflect my progress as I work through the courses. Please feel free to use and distribute these notes for your own purposes!

## Contributing
I welcome and encourage others to contribute to these notes. If you find typos, feel free to fix them and make a pull request. If you have a full set or notes you want to add, same. If you just want to add something that you feel is missing or want to alter something to make it clearer, that's cool too. These notes use markdown and I try to format them in an expository format, like you're reading a tutorial but this format is loose and some notes take a more point-form approach.
